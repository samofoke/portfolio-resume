              As a Software Engineer with a rich background in developing robust
              end-to-end web solutions. My technical journey spans over 4+
              years, deeply involved in front-end and back-end development
              across diverse frameworks like React, Angular, and Next.js,
              coupled with Node.js, Express.js and Flask expertise.

              My interest in computations is deeply rooted in the intricate
              world of data structures and algorithms. To me, the elegance and
              complexity of computations lie in how data is structured,
              accessed, and manipulated to solve problems efficiently. My
              fascination extends to exploring various algorithmic designs,
              understanding their nuances, and appreciating their potential to
              transform raw data into meaningful insights.
